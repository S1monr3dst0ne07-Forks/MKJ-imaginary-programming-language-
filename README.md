yo so, i came up with the custom programming language (exists in my imagination), but i've made a folder that contains all mkj scripts i made, you can look inside them and study them (they also have output at the end).

if you are having problems understanding the part of mkj code, let me know in the "Issues" tab (and also send me which script file and which code snippet so i know exactly what you mean), and ill try to explain to you more details about it.
