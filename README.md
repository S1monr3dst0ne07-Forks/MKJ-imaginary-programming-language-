yo so, i came up with the custom programming language (exists in my imagination), but i've made all of mkj scripts, you can look inside them and analyze them (they also have output at the end).

if you are having problems understanding the part of mkj code, let me know in the "Issues" tab (and also send me which script file and which code snippet so i know exactly what you mean), and ill try to explain to you more details about it.
